                                Currency trading offers amazing profit potential, but includes also large risk potential. Therefore, currency trading on margin may not be suitable for all individuals. The high leverage offered in the currency market can work against you as well as for you.

                                Before you get started with trading in the foreign exchange market with any other Expert Advisor, you should consider your investment goals, objectives, trading experience and your personal risk appetite. You should be also aware of the existing possibility that you could lose some or, in the worst case, all of your initial investment. For this reason, currency trading should only be undertaken with risk capital. The definition of risk capital is the funds that are not necessary to the survival or well being of the user.  Make yourself aware of all possibly risks associated with trading currencies on margin. If you have any doubts or concerns you should seek advice form an independent financial advisor. <br>

In fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and the actual results subsequently achieved by any particular trading program. Hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk, and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading.All information on this website is for educational purposes only and is not intended to provide financial advice.
